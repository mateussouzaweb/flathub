        <p>NiceDeck is an alternative for automated installations softwares like EmuDeck and RetroDeck. It tries to keep things as independent as possible by just focusing on installing the programs, while also adding it to the Steam Library with nice cover images. It was originally created for Steam Deck, but works on almost any Linux distro.</p>
        <p>With NiceDeck, you can automate the installation of recommended softwares for general usage, gaming and retro console emulation inside your Steam Deck or Linux machine with Steam Software. It also contains a built-in parser to grab information and add ROMs from consoles to the Steam Library automatically.</p>
        <p>If you want to learn more about the features of NiceDeck, such as available programs, the platforms that can be emulated or anything else, please visit the project website.</p>
